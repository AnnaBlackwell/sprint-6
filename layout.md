Observations and notes about layout tutorial:

I went through the whole layout tutorial, and while most of it was revision, things that were new to me were flexbox, columns, relative positions, and box-sizing.

Ever since I went through the tutorials on media queries and responsive design on team treehouse a couple of weeks ago, I've been especially aware of and annoyed at non-mobile friendly websites I come across. It makes it a pretty easy decision to leave the website and go straight to a competitor. This seems like a big missed opportunity, considering how simple it is to solve. The hard part is probably finding a developer!
