How I plan to address accessibility requirements in general, and specifically media-related issues, on your personal website:

The website that I have been planning throughout phase zero would primarily be text and image-based. I can't imagine needing to include videos or audio. In this site, ARIA attributes and alt text for images, and sufficient contrast should be used throughout. The site will also include maps with pins to indicate locations. These could be given alternative text with physical addresses to make these maps more accessible.

In any site that did include other media such as videos or audio, these should include both synchronized captions and a transcript.

I think a AA is a reasonable conformance level to strive for.

NZ laws that regulate accessibility of websites and applications:

The main law mandating web accessibility in NZ is the <a href https://webtoolkit.govt.nz/standards/web-accessibility-standard-1-0/>New Zealand Web Accessibility Standard 1.0.</a>

This requires government websites to meet the 5 conformance requirements of the WCAG2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to an AA level of conformance.
