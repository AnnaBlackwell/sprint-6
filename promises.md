Two things you must do to keep link "promises":

1. Write descriptive, true link text;

2. Immediately display what the user expects to see — right on the link’s destination page.

Three things I'd probably do to prevent link rot on my sites:

1. Avoid interrupting the user's train of thought by requiring them to do tangential things, like fill out a form before reaching the destination.

2. Confirm the user's assumptions about the destination, by putting expected content in default viewable area, clear headings and  relevant images.


3. Use clear link text that make it clear what the user can expect the destination to be.
